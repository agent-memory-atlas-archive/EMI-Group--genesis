defmodule EvoGit.AgentScheduler.PubSubTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for the supervised broadcast throttle `EvoGit.AgentScheduler.PubSub.Throttle`.

  The throttle coalesces rapid `:schedule` casts into ONE `{:agents_updated, node}`
  broadcast on the `"agents"` topic at most 200ms after the last cast — the
  trailing element is the emitting BEAM node (`node()`). It runs
  as a standard child of the application's `EvoGit.Supervisor` (declared in
  `EvoGit.Application`'s children after `Phoenix.PubSub`, `:permanent`
  restart).

  Uses `async: false` because the throttle process and the `EvoGit.PubSub`
  topic are global — shared with the running application and other test
  modules. Mailbox drains before each measurement window keep the assertions
  deterministic even if other (serialized) tests broadcast to the same topic.
