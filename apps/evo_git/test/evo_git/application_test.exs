defmodule EvoGit.ApplicationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for ETS table ownership.

  The three global ETS tables (`:evogit_agent_state`, `:evogit_sched_meta`,
  `:evogit_archive_records`) must be created by `EvoGit.Application.start/2`
  (owned by the application process) — NOT by `AgentScheduler.init/1`. This
  ensures they survive an `AgentScheduler` crash/restart.

  Previously the tables were created in `AgentScheduler.init/1`, which meant a
  scheduler crash destroyed them. On restart they were recreated empty, causing
  the dashboard's `TaskRegistry` to see no sched_meta entries and spuriously
  mark tasks as `:failed`.

  Uses `async: false` because the tests manipulate the global named ETS tables
  and the global `EvoGit.Supervisor` supervision tree.
