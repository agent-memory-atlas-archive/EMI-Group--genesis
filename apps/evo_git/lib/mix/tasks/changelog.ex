defmodule Mix.Tasks.Changelog do
  @moduledoc """
  Generate an AI-powered Keep-a-Changelog section for a new version.

  Collects the pull requests / merges in the commit history since the last git
  tag (or a custom range) by walking the first-parent line, summarizes each
  change with an LLM into a single user-facing line (map stage), then
  aggregates those lines into categorized changelog entries (reduce stage),
  and maintains `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog format. A missing file is
  created with a `# Changelog` title, an intro line, and an empty
  `## [Unreleased]` section. An existing file gets the new `## [<version>]`
  section inserted right after the header — or replaced in place when a
  section for the same version already exists (re-runs are idempotent and
  never duplicate a section).

  ## Usage

      mix changelog <version> [--from <ref>] [--to <ref>] [--model <id>] [--file <path>]

  Options:

    * `--from <ref>` — range start. Defaults to the last tag via
      `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`; when no tag exists the full history
      is used.
    * `--to <ref>` — range end. Defaults to `HEAD`.
    * `--model <id>` — LLM model profile used for the summary. Defaults to
      `deepseek:deepseek-v4-flash`.
    * `--file <path>` — changelog file path. Defaults to `CHANGELOG.md` in
      the current directory.

  Collection is **PR/merge-aware**: the first-parent line of the range is
  walked (`git log --first-parent <from>..<to>`), and each merge commit (≥ 2
  parents) becomes one change whose commits are the branch commits it brought
  in (`git log --no-merges <merge>^1..<merge>` — `--no-merges` skips nested
  agent merges; GitHub-style single-commit merges yield exactly one commit).
  Non-merge commits on the first-parent line become single-commit changes.
  The merge message itself is never used as the signal. Version-bump commits
  (subjects matching `^Bump version to`) and obvious mechanical noise
  (`^Update mix hash`, `^Update CONTEXT.md`) are filtered from every change's
  commit list; a change left with no commits is dropped entirely. Docs-only
  commits (README rewording, documentation / CONTEXT.md edits, comment-only
  work) carry no user-facing code change; only commit subjects/bodies are
  collected (never file paths), so their exclusion is PROMPT-driven: stage 1
  summarizes code-relevant changes only and marks entirely non-user-facing
  changes with a fixed docs-only marker that the pipeline drops before
  stage 2 — such changes never become entries.

  Summarization is **two-stage (map-reduce)**: stage 1 produces one concise
  user-facing summary line per change (one LLM call per change, taking that
  change's commits); stage 2 aggregates the per-change summaries into the
  final Keep-a-Changelog entries in a single LLM call. Stage 2 also merges
  **related changes across PRs/merges**: separate merges that add, fix, and
  improve the same feature collapse into ONE entry describing the end / net
  user-visible state (e.g. "Add feature xyz"). Stage 1 classifies by user
  impact: a change mixing real code work with docs churn is summarized for
  its code-relevant part only, and an entirely non-user-facing change
  (docs-only) is summarized as the fixed marker dropped before stage 2; a
  release whose changes are all non-user-facing short-circuits like the
  empty-range path and leaves CHANGELOG.md untouched. After writing the file
  the task interactively asks whether to commit it; if confirmed only the
  changelog file is staged and committed (never `git add -A`).

  ## Examples

      # Summarize everything since the last tag
      mix changelog 0.2.0

      # Explicit range
      mix changelog 0.2.0 --from v0.1.0 --to v0.2.0

  ## Test seam

  The pipeline is routed through three seams; each defaults to the real
  `ReqLLM` implementation and can be substituted deterministically. There are
  two injection points, resolved **at call time**, in this precedence order:

    1. a per-call `opts` override passed to `run/1` as a keyword entry
       (e.g. `Changelog.run(["0.2.0", changelog_summarizer: fun])`) — async-safe;
    2. the repo-wide `Application.get_env(:evo_git, ...)` value (the
       long-standing pattern, cf. `:peak_hours_now_fun`, `:remote_rpc_timeout`).

    * `:changelog_summarizer` — the whole pipeline
      `(model, version, prs) -> {:ok, entries} | {:error, reason}` where
      `prs` is the PR list. Defaults to `__MODULE__.summarize_pipeline/3`.
    * `:changelog_pr_summarizer` — stage 1 (map), one call per PR
      `(model, version, pr) -> {:ok, summary :: String.t()} | {:error, reason}`
      where `pr = %{head_sha: String.t(), commits: [%{hash, subject, body}]}`.
      Defaults to `__MODULE__.summarize_pr_with_llm/3`.
    * `:changelog_aggregator` — stage 2 (reduce)
      `(model, version, summaries :: [String.t()]) -> {:ok, entries} | {:error, reason}`.
      Defaults to `__MODULE__.aggregate_with_llm/3`.

  Two further keyword entries let a test run without VM-global state:

    * `root: <dir>` — anchors every git invocation (`cd: root`) and resolves
      every relative file path under `root`, instead of relying on the
      process-wide CWD (`File.cd!`). Defaults to `File.cwd!()`.
    * `shell: <shell>` — the `Mix.Shell` used for all info/error/yes? output,
      instead of swapping the VM-global `Mix.shell/1` (which writes a global
      ETS table). Precedence: `opts[:shell]` → app env `:mix_shell` →
      `Mix.shell()`.

  `entries` is a list of `%{category, text}` maps (string- or atom-keyed);
  the aggregation schema/output stays exactly compatible with
  `normalize_entries/1` and `build_section/2`.

    You are writing release notes for version #{version} of this software project.

    Below are the per-change summaries of the pull requests / merges included
    in this release (each line is one change). Write a concise, user-facing
    changelog in Keep a Changelog style, grouped into the categories below.
    Include ONLY categories that have entries.

    Categories (use exactly these names):
    Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security, Deprecated

    IMPORTANT — merge related changes across PRs:
    Multiple PRs/merges in this release may concern the same feature or bug.
    For example, one merge ADDS feature xyz, a later one FIXES a bug in
    feature xyz, and another IMPROVES feature xyz. All such related changes
    MUST be merged into a SINGLE changelog entry that describes the end / net
    user-visible state (e.g. "Add feature xyz" for the add -> fix -> improve
    sequence) — NOT one entry per PR. Choose the most representative category,
    usually the one of the primary / introducing change.

    IMPORTANT — code changes only:
    The changelog must contain ONLY code-related changes that matter to users.
    Do NOT include entries describing non-code or docs-only work: README
    updates, documentation rewording, CONTEXT.md or docs-file edits,
    comment-only changes, website-only updates. If a summary line describes
    nothing but documentation work, omit it entirely.

    Rules:
    - Each entry is a short user-facing sentence fragment (no commit hashes,
      author names, or file paths).
    - Ignore mechanical/trivial changes (chore, formatting, dependency churn,
      pure refactors with no user impact) unless they are meaningful.
