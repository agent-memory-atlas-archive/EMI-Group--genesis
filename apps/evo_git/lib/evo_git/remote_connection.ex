defmodule EvoGit.RemoteConnection do
  @moduledoc """
  GenServer managing the lifecycle of a single SSH remote connection.

  There are two distinct operations, kept deliberately separate:

    * **Bootstrap** (`bootstrap/1`, `bootstrap/2`) — "first time setup": gets a
      `genesis_remote` release tarball onto the remote host and launches it as
      a daemon (`systemd-run --user` on Linux, `launchctl` on macOS). The
      daemon then runs independently and stays up even after the local side
      disconnects. Bootstrap does NOT connect. Bootstrap NEVER stops an
      already-running daemon without explicit user permission — see the
      `:on_running` option of `bootstrap/2`.

      The tarball comes from one of two sources:

        * **Local tarball** — when the target's `local_binary_path` is set and
          the file exists, it is uploaded via CLI `scp` (unchanged behavior).
          When set but missing, a warning is logged and bootstrap falls back
          to automatic download — a stale path should not hard-fail bootstrap
          (VS Code Remote-SSH semantics).

        * **Automatic download** (no usable `local_binary_path`) — mirrors
          VS Code Remote-SSH: bootstrap probes the remote platform
          (`uname -s && uname -m`, or the target's optional `platform` field
          when set, which skips the probe), resolves the matching release
          tarball from GitHub, and downloads it (curl on the remote host,
          falling back to wget on the remote host when curl is missing or
          fails, then to a local curl into a data-dir cache followed by
          `scp`). It then proceeds with the same extract / chmod / config-copy
          / cookie / launch steps.

  ## Bootstrap stages

  Progress is broadcast via `Phoenix.PubSub` on `"remote_connections"` as
  `{:remote_connection_status, target_id, %{bootstrap_stage: stage, ...}}`:

  Local-tarball path: `:probing_platform` → `:uploading` → `:extracting` →
  `:setting_permissions` → `:copying_config` → `:generating_cookie` →
  (`:patching_binaries` only on NixOS) → `:starting_daemon`.

  Auto-download path: `:probing_platform` → `:downloading` (→
  `:downloading_locally` when both the remote curl and wget attempts fail and
  the local fallback kicks in) → `:extracting` → `:setting_permissions` →
  `:copying_config` → `:generating_cookie` → (`:patching_binaries` only on
  NixOS) → `:starting_daemon`.

  Before any staging, bootstrap performs a silent pre-flight: it resolves the
  remote OS (the target's optional `platform` field, else one
  `uname -s && uname -m` probe) and checks whether the daemon is already
  running. When it is:

    * with `on_running: :refuse` (the default), bootstrap refuses without
      touching anything — no staging, no kill, no broadcast — and returns
      `{:error, {:daemon_running, details}}`; re-bootstrapping would stop the
      running daemon and any tasks running on it. The caller should show a
      permission dialog from this tuple;
    * with `on_running: :restart`, the `:stopping_daemon` stage is broadcast
      and the running daemon is stopped (`systemctl --user stop` on Linux,
      `launchctl unload` on macOS) before the normal staging flow starts a
      fresh daemon with the current contract.

  `:patching_binaries` is broadcast only when the remote is NixOS (Linux +
  daemon not already running + NixOS detected) and is skipped otherwise: on
  NixOS hosts the extracted release's ELF binaries are patched on the fly
  with a Nix-built `patchelf` (the glibc tarball cannot execute there without
  it). A live daemon is never patched.

    * **Connection** (`connect/1`) — establishes an SSH tunnel forwarding the
      remote distribution port to loopback, then performs Erlang distribution
      (`Node.connect/1`) to the remote node so that RPC (`:erpc.call/4`) and
      PubSub can flow over the tunnel.

  All SSH operations use CLI `ssh`/`scp` via `Port.open` — no Erlang `:ssh`
  or `:ssh_sftp` modules are used. The `ssh_target` field is just a string
  (host alias or `user@host`); port and identity file are handled by the
  user's `~/.ssh/config`.

  One `EvoGit.RemoteConnection` GenServer is started per active connection
  target (looked up / started on demand via the `EvoGit.RemoteConnection.Registry`
  and the `EvoGit.RemoteConnection.Supervisor` DynamicSupervisor).

  ## Async connect (event-driven, non-blocking)

  `connect/1` is NON-BLOCKING: it replies `{:ok, :connecting}` (or
  `{:ok, :connected}` when already connected) as soon as the connect is
  initiated and returns control to the caller immediately. The blocking I/O —
  `Distribution.enable_for_remote/1`, the ssh spawn, the tunnel-readiness poll
  (`wait_for_tunnel/4`) and `Node.connect/1` — runs in a MONITORED worker
  process started by the GenServer, so the manager stays responsive
  (`status/1`/`connected?/1`/`disconnect/1`/`list_connections/0`) for the whole
  connect. The GenServer remains the SINGLE owner of phase state: every phase
  transition happens in the GenServer process, which broadcasts it on
  `"remote_connections"` as `{:remote_connection_status, target_id, status_map}`.

  Lifecycle broadcasts (same topic/shape as bootstrap):

    * `:connecting` — emitted when a connect starts (in `handle_call(:connect)`)
    * `:connected` — emitted on success (existing behavior)
    * `:error` with `last_error` populated — emitted on EVERY failure arm
      (distribution failed, no free port, tunnel not ready / ssh exited,
      node connect failed, worker crash)
    * `:disconnected` — emitted when `disconnect/1` aborts an in-flight connect

  Duplicate connects are idempotent: a second `connect/1` while the target is
  already `:connecting` (or `:connected`) is a no-op that acks promptly and
  never spawns a second tunnel.

  ### Internal message protocol

  Connect worker → GenServer:

    * `{:connect_result, worker_pid, {:ok, %{port:, local_port:, node_name:}}}`
      — connect succeeded. The worker transfers the tunnel `Port` to the
      GenServer (`Port.connect/2`) BEFORE sending this message, so the tunnel
      survives the worker's exit; the GenServer records the port, arms the
      heartbeat and broadcasts `:connected`.
    * `{:connect_result, worker_pid, {:error, message}}` — connect failed. The
      worker already closed the tunnel port itself. The GenServer stores
      `message` as `last_error` and broadcasts `:error`.

  The GenServer monitors the worker (`Process.monitor/1`, stored in
  `state.connect_worker`); a `:DOWN` for the current worker with no result
  having arrived means the worker crashed → `:error` broadcast.

  GenServer → worker: none required — the worker exits on its own after
  reporting. Killing the worker (`Process.exit(pid, :kill)`) is how
  `disconnect/1` aborts an in-flight connect: the worker owns the tunnel port
  until success, so killing it closes the ssh tunnel; if the worker already
  transferred the port, the GenServer's own termination (disconnect stops the
  manager) closes it.

  ## Port monitoring

  While `:connected`, the SSH tunnel `Port` is owned by this (GenServer)
  process. With `Process.flag(:trap_exit, true)` set in `init/1`, tunnel death
  arrives as a `{:EXIT, port, reason}` message, triggering a transition to
  `:error`. During `:connecting` the port is owned by the connect worker (see
  above); the GenServer only takes ownership once the connect succeeds.

  No `try/rescue` blocks are used — all fallible operations use `case`/`with`
  with non-crashing variants.
