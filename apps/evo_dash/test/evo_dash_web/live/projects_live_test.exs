  # `git rev-parse HEAD` succeeds, so the wrapper spawns a couple of instant
  # ports and then returns the node-path error. Without the seed the wrapper

# A minimal GenServer standing in for a real remote connection manager in
# `EvoGit.RemoteConnection.Registry` (same pattern as
# EvoDashWeb.NodeAwareTest.ConnectionManager). `connect/1` on the real manager
# resolves the registered pid via the Registry and calls `:connect`; the fake
# answers with a configurable result so `retry_remote_connection` /
# `select_node` never start real SSH machinery. The process dies (and its
# Registry entry is auto-removed) at test end via `start_supervised!`.
#
# Startup shapes (preserving the original 2-tuple for existing call sites):
#   * `{target_id, status}` — `:connect` answers `{:ok, :connecting}`
#   * `{target_id, status, opts}` — `opts` may set `:connect_result` (the
#     `:connect` reply, default `{:ok, :connecting}`) and `:connect_delay_ms`
#     (sleep before replying, to prove the caller runs off-process).
#
# Extra calls used by the event-driven async-connect tests:
#   * `{:set_status, status}` — test-driven phase mutation (the broadcast →
#     gate reconciliation path re-reads the LIVE manager, so the stored status
#     must flip before the broadcast is sent)
#   * `:calls` / `:callers` — recorded `:connect` invocation count / caller
#     pids (a caller that is neither the LiveView process nor the test process
#     proves the connect ran on `EvoDash.TaskSupervisor`).
