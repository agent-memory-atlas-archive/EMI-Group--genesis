  # Mount helper — deterministic settle of the page's ASYNC loads
  # ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Every Settings page mount kicks off an async load on EvoDash.TaskSupervisor:
  # `SettingsLive.NodeData.start/3` (from handle_params/3) reads config.toml and
  # reports back `{:settings_node_data_loaded, node, category, results}`, whose
  # handler REPLACES the `:file_config` assign with the snapshot it read; the
  # NodeAware hook additionally spawns its sidebar fetch. The node-data task
  # reads the config at its START but only sends the message after its remaining
  # work, so under scheduler load the apply routinely lands AFTER the first event
  # a test drives — reverting the state the test just mutated (that is what
  # intermittently broke the editor/save/list-editing assertions in full-suite
  # runs: `current_models/1` came back empty, and the editor render lost the
  # profile being edited).
  #
  # `mount_settings/2` funnels every mount in this file through a deterministic
  # settle: wait for THIS mount's async tasks to exit, then drain their result
  # messages (render/1 performs a synchronous round-trip, so everything queued
  # before it — including the node-data apply — is processed first). Only then is
  # the view handed to the test, so no stale apply can arrive mid-test.
  #
  # The ORIGINAL mount HTML is returned unchanged: the "shell seeding (async
  # platform gating)" describe asserts on the seed-shell render that live/3
  # always returns.

    #    inner scroll div). The `md:h-full` on the outer wrapper
    #    (settings_live.ex) and the sidebar are correct and must stay.

    #    min-size 0); search/`:remote_connections`/`:agents` work because the
